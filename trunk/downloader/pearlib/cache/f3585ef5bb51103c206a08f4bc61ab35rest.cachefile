<h3>Notes</h3>Make sure you change the default keywords, description and title System=>Configuration=>Design HTML Head
It may a good idea to add rel="nofollow" to some hyperlinks in the CMS pages / CMS blocks.
The rel="nofollow" of the footer hyperlinks are removed. The idea was to follow these links only from the home page and add rel="noffolow" for all other pages. But with caching enabled this give some problems. I will fix this soon.
